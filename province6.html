<b>3. Sinja Valley</b>
<br><br
<p>Sinja Valley contains the archaeological evidence of the capital city of the well organized and influential Western Malla or Khasa Kingdom of the 12th and 14th Century. After the 14th Century the Khasa Kingdom split into the Baise or Twenty-Two Kingdoms which existed until the unification of Nepal in the late 18th Century. Excavations have revealed the remains of old palaces, temples (Kanak Sundari, Tripura Sundari) and the old settlement. A remarkable ring of huge monolithic stone columns were found surrounding the ruins of the ancient settlement with a Malla gateway and steps. Earthen pipes were excavated testifying to an elaborate water supply system. Across from the Hima River there are caves with ancient votive Buddhist chaityas and cliff inscriptions. Even today the ancient rites of the Masto (Shamans) are practiced in many of the stone Dewals or temples.The Sinja Valley was where the Nepali language originates from and the earliest examples of the Devanagari script from the 13th Century were found on the cliffs and in nearby Dullu.
