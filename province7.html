	<b> 1. Badimalika Temple</b><br><br>
    
	<p> 
Badimalika temple is a Hindu temple which is located in Triveni Municipality, Bajura district of Sudhurpashchin(Far-Western) Province. It is dedicated to Bhagwati(goddess Durga). Badimalika is the newest trekking route. Malika Chaturdashi is the major annual festival that is held in this temple, where pilgrims come from all over Nepal thinking that their wishes will be fulfilled if they pray at the temple. The temple is served by two priests, one representing Kalikot district and the other from Bajura district.
Badimalika is the hardest trekking route, one has to make a difficult trek lasting 2-3 days from Martadi, the headquarters of Bajura to reach Badimalika. Because the route of that temple is not well developed, there is a lack of accommodation facilities. So all the necessary goods need to be carried by ourselves.
Badimalika is one of the latest trekking trails that were recognized by the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal (TAAN) that had the possibility of offering its visitors wonderful Himalayas views that include Api and Saipal Himal.</p>

<b> 2. khaptad National Park </b>
<p><br>
Khaptad National Park is located in the Far-western region of Nepal. The park was gazetted in 1984 covering an area of 225 sq. km. The area of buffer zone is 216 sq.km. The park is the only mid-mountain national park in western Nepal, representing a unique and important ecosystem. The late Khaptad Swami moved to the area in 1940's to meditate and worship. He spent about 50 years as a hermit and became a renowned spiritual saint. The park offers a challenging yet rewarding experience unlike any other protected area in Nepal.. The Khaptad Baba Ashram is located near the park headquarters. The Tribeni confluence made by three rivers, and a Shiva temple are on the way to Park Headquarters. Ganga Dashahara is celebrated here during Jestha Purnima and many pilgrims visit the park during the festival. Sahashra Linga is another religious site situated at 3,200 m above sea level which is the highest point in the park. Other religious places include Ganesh temple, Nagdhunga and Kedardhunga. These areas are considered as places for meditation and tranquillity and should not be disturbed. Tobacco products, alcohol, and sacrificing of animals are prohibited in these areas. There is a small museum and a view tower at the park headquarters. To the north one can see the Saipal Himalayan Ranges- In the other direction the vast green mid-hills of Nepal can be seen clearly. There are 22 open patches of Patans (pastureland) mix together with the forests inside park. The local people graze their livestock in the Patans during the summer season. In the north-eastern part of the park, there is a lake called Khaptad Daha. During the full moon of August - September a festival is called Purnima celebrated here. The best way to reach the park area is to fly from Nepalgunj to Dipayal and the local buses are available for Silgadhi, Doti. From Silgadhi Bazzar one has to hike 6 hours to the park entrance and another 7-8 hours to the Park Headquarters. Other options are-flight to Dipayal followed by a three-day walk, or flight to Achham or Bajhang followed by a two-day walk, or flight to Bajura followed by a four-day walk. However, Dipayal and Accham airport are rarely open.</p>
